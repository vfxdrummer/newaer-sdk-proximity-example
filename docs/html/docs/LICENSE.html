    LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR THE SDK AND API OF THE PROXIMITY PLATFORM 
  </h1>
  
  <p>
    This Agreement is between NewAer, makers of the innovative Proximity
    Platform, and you, the person or company that is planning to develop
    amazing Applications on said platform and whom is listed on the
    registration of our site. Our lawyers required that we have this
    contractual Agreement, but we have done our best to make it easily
    understood and short, at just about two pages.  This Agreement
    begins when you click "I Accept" below and terminates upon the
    earlier of (i) provision of a termination notice by either of us to
    the other or (ii) our mutual agreement on a fee-based commercial
    agreement.
  </p>

    <li>
      <span class="ul">License.</span> We grant you a
      non-sublicensable, non-transferable (except as described in
      Section 13), non-exclusive, terminable, limited license to (i)
      incorporate or create derivative works of the Sample Code for the
      development of Applications that utilize the Proximity Platform,
      (ii) run the SDK Code from within the Applications in accordance
      with the Documentation, and (iii) to use the SDK Code to access
      the API and Server Code in accordance with the Documentation, up
      to the to the Free Quota Limit.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <span class="ul">Free Quota.</span> The "Free Quota Limit" is
      the limit of <span class="bf">one million calls to the API and
      Server Code for each of your Applications.</span> That means one
      million “triggers” of something that leverages our
      machine-to-machine connection in your app or on the cloud.
      After you use up your Free Quota Limit, we will enter into a
      new fee-based commercial agreement with you to authorize your
      Application to have additional use of the Proximity Platform.
      The cost per API call after that start at a 1/10th of a US cent and
      goes lower based upon your API volume or any pre-paid application 
      or handset license that  you might opt to employ for your
      application. We will work out these details in a future contract.

      implied licenses under this Agreement, and any rights in or to the
